# Rent-Mangement
Initially I thought about making a backend with Laravel and front end with Flutter Desktop but due to huge workload I switched to making only the webapp. It has been developed in Django Web Framework

To run this project, you would require django already installed in your system

Change directory to project folder and open terminal and run following code

`python manage.py runserver`
